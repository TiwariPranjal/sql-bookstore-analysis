# 📚 Bookstore Sales & Customer Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a bookstore database using **PostgreSQL** to extract meaningful business insights related to **sales, customers, revenue, and inventory management**.

The data was provided in Excel (CSV) format and imported into a relational database. SQL queries were written to answer real-world business questions using joins, aggregations, and date-based analysis.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The project uses three datasets:

- **Books.csv** – Book details such as title, author, genre, price, and stock  
- **Customers.csv** – Customer information and location  
- **Orders.csv** – Order details including quantity, order date, and total amount

## 🏗️ Database Design
The database consists of three tables:

- **Books**
- **Customers**
- **Orders**

Primary keys and foreign keys were used to maintain data integrity and establish relationships between tables.
